# Resolution Switcher

tool to switch between resolutions of referenced published files...

### Step 1. 
select a locator in your scene.
(should have the right naming convention, so check the wiki or shotgun...)

### Step 2. 
click on the required resolution in the menu.

### Step 3.
Reference should change to last published file for that resolution.


## Todo:
- In the future should this tool work for multiple programms (Maya, Modo, ...)
- Should be able to choose a version?
- ...
